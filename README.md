- you can see in you lap your (IPv6 Address, Temporary IPv6 Address; Link-local IPv6 Address; IPv4 Address; Subnet Mask; Default Gateway): ``` ipconfig ```
- Default Gateway: forwards data from one network to another. (router)
- Default: designated device is the first option thats looked upon when data needs to exit the network.

# IP ADDRESS
- IP address: identifier for a computer or device on a network.
- consists of two parts: Network address, Host address.

# Subnet Mask
- [subnet mask](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_Ntt6eTn94): reveals how many bits in the IP address are used for the network by masking the network portion of the IP address
- networks can be logically broken down into smaller networks, wihich knows as subnetting.

- how to find binary number?
  8 bit octet chart(128 64 32 16 8 4 2 1) -> 128 + 64 = 192 that mean 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 becuase binary numbers are made up of 1 and 0 , 1 is count 0 does not count.
